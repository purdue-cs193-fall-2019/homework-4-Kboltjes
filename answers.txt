Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Hello this change was made on the website.
Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git status' do
The command 'git status' retrieves the differences between your local repository and the remote repository.
It tells you what branch you are on. Additionally, it tells you if you need to pull, commit, or push changes.
Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
Git is your local repository. GitHub is the central repository that everyone can see. 
People can't see changes you make to your local repository, but they can see changes made on the central repository.
